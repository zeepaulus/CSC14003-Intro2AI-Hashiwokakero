# Hashiwokakero Solver (Bridges)

This project explores AI techniques to solve the Hashiwokakero (Bridges) puzzle, a logic-based game where islands (nodes) must be connected with bridges while adhering to specific constraints. The project implements multiple algorithms including PySAT, A* Search, Backtracking, and Brute Force to solve puzzles of varying sizes and complexities. [web:5][web:8]

## How to Run the Code

Before running the code, ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. [web:8]

### 1. Install Dependencies

From the `Source` folder, install the required libraries:

```bash
cd Source
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 2. Run the Application

Execute the main GUI program:

```bash
python gui.py
```


## Features & Usage

The application provides a modern GUI with two main tabs.

### Tab 1: Single Solve

- Solve individual puzzles step-by-step.
- Load Input: Enter the input index (e.g., `1` for `input-01.txt`) and click **Load Input** to visualize the puzzle grid.
- Select Algorithm: Choose between PySAT, A*, Backtracking, or Brute Force.
- **SOLVE**: Start solving and draw bridges on the grid.
- Time (ms) and peak memory (MB) usage are displayed after solving.
- Save Result: Export the solved grid to a text file in the `Outputs` folder.

### Tab 2: Benchmark

- Compare the performance of different algorithms on multiple inputs.
- Inputs: Enter a list of input indices separated by commas (e.g., `1, 2, 5`).
- Compare: Select which algorithms to benchmark.
- Note: Brute Force and A* may be slow on large maps.
- **RUN BENCHMARK**: Runs in the background.
- View Results:
  - Toggle between Time (ms) and Memory (MB).
  - A line chart visualizes performance.
  - Click **Save Chart** to export the graph as an image. [web:6]

## Input Description (`Inputs/`)

Input files are text files representing the puzzle grid.

- `0`: Water (empty cell).
- `1` to `8`: Island with the specified required number of bridges. [web:5][web:6]

Example (`input-01.txt`):

0, 2, 0
0, 0, 0
2, 0, 2


## Output Description (`Outputs/`)

Output files store the solution matrix in a JSON-like string format.

- `-` : Single horizontal bridge.
- `=` : Double horizontal bridge.
- `|` : Single vertical bridge.
- `$` : Double vertical bridge. [web:5]

Example output:

["0", "2", "0"]
["|", "0", "|"]
["2", "-", "2"]


🎯 Happy Solving!
